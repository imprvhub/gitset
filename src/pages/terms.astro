                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">By accessing or using <strong>GitSet.dev</strong> (the "Service"), including its domain name(s), IP addresses, content, or any interactions (such as clicking on links), you acknowledge and declare that you accept this Terms of Service and <a href="/privacy" style="color: #3DA798;">Privacy Policy</a>. Your access and use of the Service indicate your acknowledgment, acceptance, and unconditional agreement to all the terms and conditions and privacy policies set forth herein without modification and you confirm that you are 18 years of age or older. This agreement takes effect immediately upon your first use of the Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must refrain from using the Service and close all windows.</p>
                            
                            <h3>2. Use of Service</h3>
                        
                            <p style="max-width: none !important;"><strong>GitSet.dev</strong> is an online platform designed to help developers automate documentation tasks, including the generation of README files, .gitignore files, semantic commit messages, and more. Access to and use of certain features may require authentication via OAuth, where users may choose to grant access to their GitHub account. However, some features remain accessible without authentication. Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their authentication credentials.</p>
                            
                            <h3>3. OAuth Authentication and User Responsibilities</h3>
                        
                            <p style="max-width: none !important;"><strong>GitSet.dev</strong> utilizes OAuth authentication to allow Users to access their GitHub repositories and perform specific tasks related to their repositories. By authenticating through OAuth, Users grant <strong>GitSet.dev</strong> access to their GitHub account, but only to the extent required for the operation of the requested features.</p>
                            
                            <p style="font-weight: 600; max-width: none !important;">
                                <span><u>Revocation of Access</u></span>: Users may revoke access granted to <italic>GitSet.dev</italic> at any time from 
                                <a style="color: #3DA798;" href="/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Settings</a> page on GitSet.dev, navigating to the "Connected Accounts" section, and selecting "Revoke GitHub Access". 
                                Additionally, users can manage OAuth applications directly through 
                                <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications" style="color: #3DA798;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub's settings</a>. 
                                TO REVOKE ACCESS, CLICK ON 'GITSET.DEV' IN THE LIST OF AUTHORIZED APPLICATIONS, SELECT THE THREE DOTS, AND CHOOSE 'REVOKE'. CONFIRM YOUR ACTION.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p style="font-weight: 600; max-width: none !important;">Users must be aware that revoking access will immediately disable all OAuth functionality provided by GitSet.dev, and the platform will no longer be able to interact with the User's GitHub repositories.</p>
                            
                            <h3>4. Security and Data Handling</h3>
                        
                            <p style="max-width: none !important;"><strong>GitSet.dev</strong> takes reasonable measures to protect the security and confidentiality of your data. However, as with all digital platforms, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. <strong>GitSet.dev</strong> disclaims any responsibility for data breaches resulting from unforeseen vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.</p>
                        
                            <h3>5. Disclaimers on AI Functionality</h3>
                        
                            <p style="max-width: none !important;"><strong>GitSet.dev</strong> employs AI technology to assist in generating semantic commit messages and README files. While the AI is designed to enhance productivity, it is important to understand that these AI-driven features are experimental and may not always generate perfect or precise results. <strong>GitSet.dev</strong> makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy or reliability of AI-generated content, and Users should verify the outputs before implementing them.</p>
                            
                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">User Responsibility: Users are solely responsible for evaluating the generated content and may choose whether to implement or discard AI-suggested commit messages or README entries. <strong>GitSet.dev</strong> will not be held liable for any consequences arising from the use of AI-generated content, including but not limited to any misunderstanding, miscommunication, or offensive text-related output that may be produced.</p>
