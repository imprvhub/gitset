                                        <br><strong>Important Notes:</strong>
                                        <br>- No code modifications or commits are made automatically; all operations remain under your control.  
                                        <br>- The 'repo' OAuth scope is necessary to enable code analysis features and generate accurate suggestions. Without this scope, accurate suggestions cannot be provided, as limited scopes do not allow code inspection of private repositories.

                                        The Gitset desktop application provides all the features of the web platform in a convenient standalone application. Here's how to install it on different operating systems:
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>Windows:</strong>
                                        <br>1. Visit <a href="/download" style="color: #3DA798;">our download page</a> and download the Windows installer (.exe)
                                        <br>2. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation prompts
                                        <br>3. Windows may display a security warning - this is normal for community-developed software
                                        <br>4. Click "Run anyway" to proceed with installation
                                        <br>5. After installation, launch Gitset from your Start menu or desktop shortcut
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>macOS:</strong>

                                        <br>2. Open the downloaded file
                                        <br>3. Drag the Gitset application to your Applications folder
                                        <br>4. When launching for the first time, macOS may display a security warning 
                                        <br>5. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy, then click "Open Anyway"

                                        <strong>Linux:</strong>
                                        <br>1. Visit <a href="/download" style="color: #3DA798;">our download page</a> and choose either:
                                        <br>   - Debian/Ubuntu (.deb): Download and install using `sudo dpkg -i gitset-desktop_[version]_amd64.deb`
                                        <br>   - AppImage: Download, make executable with `chmod +x Gitset-[version].AppImage`, and run directly
                                        <br>2. Create a desktop shortcut if desired using your distribution's method
                                        <br><br>

                                        Gitset.dev currently supports **one active subscription per user**. If you choose to upgrade or downgrade your plan, your existing subscription will be adjusted or replaced, and your new plan will take effect immediately.

                                        Regarding token usage when changing plans, **your new token limit will be applied instantly**. For example, if you downgrade from an Enterprise Plan (10,000,000 tokens/month) to a Pro Plan (1,000,000 tokens/month), your token limit will reduce to 1,000,000. Any tokens you've already consumed in your current monthly cycle will count towards your new, lower limit. If your used tokens already exceed this new limit, your quota will be marked as "exceeded" until the start of your next monthly billing cycle, when your tokens will reset.
